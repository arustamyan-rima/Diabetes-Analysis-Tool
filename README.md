# Diabetes Analysis Project

This project is designed to analyze data related to diabetes outcomes. It reads data from a CSV file, performs calculations, and generates a new CSV file with specific information.
Installation

To use this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can clone the repository and run the provided script. Make sure you have the required CSV file (diabetes2.csv) in the same directory.

# Usage

This script reads data from the diabetes2.csv file and filters out records with a specific outcome. It then calculates various statistical measures, such as median and mean of BMI and age, and writes the results to a new CSV file named diabetes_positiv_outcome.csv.

# Requirements

    Python 3.x
    Libraries: csv, statistics, pathlib

Make sure to check the **diabetes_positiv_outcome.csv** file for the filtered data.
